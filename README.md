# Guess-the-Number

This is my first Python project, after approximately one week of learning Python. I have built this game in a procedure python code (not object oriented). The game can be played in two modes, human vs human, or human vs computer. Flexible game navigation, input validation, exceptions and so on. The point of this is to get me used to Python and learn from what I'm doing.

You may use this for any purpose you wish. I have developed this for learning purposes and you may use it, play with it and get back to me if there is any suggestions, imporovements, etc.

The game is basically gussing a number between 1 and 10. First peson to guess, wins.
You can play vs the computer, or vs some friend!
I added many stuff that may or may not be necessary, remember, I never said this is the most efficient way of doing it. I just did it with my own logical approach towards solving problems and developing that skill.

Thank you.

I would love to hear from you.
