# Guess-the-Number

(MACHINE LEARNING)

This is my first Python project, after approximately one week of learning Python. 
I have built this game in a procedure python code (not object oriented). 

The game can be played in two modes, human vs human, or human vs computer.
First to guess the number (with the help of the hints) wins.

Flexible game navigation, input validation, basic exceptions and so on.
The point of this is to get me used to Python and learn from what I'm doing.
